## Sprint Retrospective 
### What Went Well

Continuous Integration was successfully implemented and automated, improving workflow reliability.
Visuals and Sound Effects made significant progress â€” most sprites completed and new sound effects integrated.
Gameboard and Movement Logic are fully functional, allowing stable testing of gameplay interactions.
Team collaboration was effective, with clear role ownership and consistent updates during daily scrums.

### What Could Be Improved

Decorative Features (UI polish) and Initialization of pieces were not started, showing prioritization issues or time constraints.

Some bugs in combat logic remained unresolved at sprint end.

Time estimation accuracy could be improved â€” several tasks took longer or were delayed.

### What to Improve for Next Sprint

Prioritize completing Initialization of pieces and UI decorations to enable full gameplay flow.

Allocate buffer time for bug fixes and testing earlier in the sprint.

Continue refining CI pipeline to include automated testing for gameplay features.

Reassess task ownership and load balancing to avoid bottlenecks near the end of the sprint.

### Key Learnings
Incremental development works best â€” focusing on completing small, testable features each sprint ensures steady progress toward a playable game.

Continuous Integration improved team efficiency, helping catch issues early and streamline collaboration.
