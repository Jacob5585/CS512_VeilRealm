## Sprint Retrospective
### What Went Well
All team members installed the same Unity version where regardless of security warning issues, we avoid any compatibility issues.

GitHub repository was established early, ensuring smooth collaboration and version control throughout the sprint.

Clear role assignments where everyone had defined responsibilities, reducing confusion and overlap.

Progress on key visual elements: created the starting screen, added sound effects, and 10x10 gameboard. Sprites are almost done, which is great, as the next stage which would be sprite animations would come pretty soon.

There was solid team communication where the regular meetings helped us stay on track and identify problems early.

### What Could Have Gone Better
As it was the first sprint, it took a while to get everyone's systems to work with the right setups. 

There was a lack of understanding of scrum in the beginning of the sprint, making it hard to view what needed to be delivered.

### What to Improve for Next Sprint
Certain tasks like ‚Äúplayer input‚Äù should be divided into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g. select pieces, validation of moves for certain pieces).

We should take note of tasks and their time complexities when looking at the sprints' capacities.

### Closing Statement
Overall, Sprint 1 laid a solid foundation for development. While there were a few startup challenges, the team adapted quickly and is better positioned for the next sprint.
