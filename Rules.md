## Breakdown and Rules
Stratego is a game of imperfect information. In addition to calculated sequences of moves, this gives rise to aspects of battling psychology, from bluffs to concealment to waiting and guessing.
This is a two player strategy game on a 10x10 board. 
There are X number of pieces the player will have at beginning of the game.
Players could have their pieces randomly generated on their side, or choose where to put their pieces down on their side before the game begins. 

There are two ways of winning:
1. If the enemy player has NO MOVEABLE pieces anymore (Pieces of ranks 1-10 are all defeated)
2. If anyone of your pieces encounters the enemy's flag

# Gameplay
Player Turn Begins
Player moves a moveable piece, piece identity is hidden from the enemy and they can only move one space (exception of if it's Scout/Goblin (2), where if they move more than 1 space their identity is revealed for their turn), 
If piece the player tries moving them to has an enemy piece it attacks it (will reveal both pieces identity to player and enemy), 
Higher number wins (except for Assassin(1) and Dragon Lord(10)) and if it was the attacker that won, they move to where the defeated piece was, 
Same number kills both the pieces, 
Pieces will die when attacking a bomb EXCEPT if the attacking piece is a Miner/Sapper(3)
Ends the player's turn to switch to the enemy player (will hide piece's identity if any of them were revealed to the enemy within the turn)
This will keep going until one of the two ways of winning are met.

# Movement
Most of the movement is already mentioned above in Gameplay, but with more clarity:
All movable pieces, with the exception of the Scout, may move only one step to any adjacent space vertically or horizontally (but not diagonally).â€Š
A piece may not move onto a space occupied by a ally piece or obstacle, if they move to a space occupied by an enemy, they attack it instead.
When attacking piece wins the encounter with enemy piece, it goes to the space the enemy piece was.
Bomb and Flag pieces are not moveable.
The Scout may move any number of spaces in a straight line (such as the rook in chess).

# Revealing of Pieces
Most is already mentioned above in Gameplay, but with more clarity:
The player will only be able to see their ally pieces' identities. The enemy player will only be able to see their own pieces' identities.
When the enemy player moves their piece, it will not reveal the piece's identity with the exception of the Scout/Goblin(2), and the enemy Scout/Goblin (2) has to be moving two or more spaces for their identity to be revealed to the player.
It is only when the pieces are being attacked do both the attacking piece and defending piece's identities get revealed to both players.
When the turn ends, any enemy piece's identity that was revealed will go back to being hidden.


# Special Pieces Rules
The Marshal/Dragon Lord (10) is the most powerful piece with a power of 10, but it has a mechanic with the Assassin(1) where if the Assassin is the attacking piece, the Dragon Lord can be defeated.
The Spy/Assassin (1) is the weakest piece where any attacking piece can defeat it, but if it attacks the Dragon Lord (10), it is able to defeat the Dragon Lord.
The Miner/Sapper (3) is able to defuse/get rid of bombs without dying when attacking them.
The Scout/Goblin (2) is able to move any distance horizontally or vertically without jumping over pieces (such as the rook in chess), can move and attack in the same turn, 
However, moving distances greater than 1 space reveals their identity to the enemy player. The player can have them move one piece instead to hide their identity.
